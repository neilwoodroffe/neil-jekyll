## Hello World

Welcome to my GitHub home page. I've had an interest in computer programming/coding since childhood. I remember my first taste of programming in the early 80s was BASIC on my Intellivision and soon after on my Commodore 64. My interest was reignited in about 2009, when I started playing video games with my son and became curious about game engines. I began to read and try out several C based languages and to my surprise I was soon able to understand the syntax. Unfortunately I am not yet proficient at any one programming language, but I hope one day to be an expert in several languages. Please enjoy my GitHub projects thus far and there will be many more to come!
